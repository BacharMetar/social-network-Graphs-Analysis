# Graphs Community Detection Algorithm - Label Propagation

## Overview

This project implements a community detection algorithm based on label propagation. The goal is to partition a given graph into cohesive communities based on the connectivity patterns of its nodes.

## Difficulties Faced

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Translating the theoretical concepts of the label propagation algorithm into efficient and scalable code posed a significant challenge. Understanding the nuances of label propagation and adapting them to different types of graphs required thorough research and experimentation.

2. **Optimization**: One of the main difficulties encountered was optimizing the algorithm for performance, especially when dealing with large-scale graphs. Finding the right balance between accuracy and efficiency, and tuning parameters to achieve optimal results, was a non-trivial task.

3. **Visualization**: Visualizing the graph and its communities posed challenges, particularly in handling overlapping nodes and choosing appropriate colors to distinguish between different communities. Ensuring clarity and interpretability in the visualization required careful design decisions.

4. **Parameter Tuning**: Tuning algorithm parameters, such as freezing thresholds and maximum iterations, proved to be essential for achieving desirable outcomes. Experimenting with various parameter configurations and understanding their impact on the algorithm's behavior was a key part of the development process.

## Algorithm Implementation

The algorithm was implemented in Python, leveraging the NetworkX library for graph manipulation and visualization. Key components of the implementation include label propagation, modularity calculation, and convergence checking. The algorithm iteratively updates node labels based on the labels of their neighbors, aiming to maximize modularityâ€”a measure of community structure quality.

## Usage

To use the algorithm:

1. Install the required dependencies (`networkx`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `tabulate`).
2. Load your graph data into the appropriate format (CSV file).
3. Choose algorithm parameters such as freezing threshold and maximum iterations.
4. Run the algorithm and visualize the results using the provided functions.
